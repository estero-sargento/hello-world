# hello-world
I am committed to following learning direction from the Github website.
I have a BA in anthropology and along the way did some Python coding for satellite data imagery that was part of my undergraduate thesis. I want to develop that coding further to enable me to generate more reports from the data I do have, and, continue to use recent data moving forward. Along the way I want to learn how to code Python "professionally" using standards that people in the software development business might identify.
